## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Backend**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations handle schema updates

### Environment Configuration
- Development: Local development with Vite dev server
- Production: Optimized builds with static asset serving
- Database: Environment-based connection strings

### Hosting Considerations
- Static assets served from Express in production
- Database migrations run via `drizzle-kit push`
- Environment variables required for database connectivity

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Hot reload, source maps, development banners
- **Production**: Optimized bundles, static serving, error handling
- **Replit Integration**: Special handling for Replit development environment
